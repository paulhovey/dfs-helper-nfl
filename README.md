# Daily Fantasy Helper (NFL)

## What is it?

This repository contains a couple of Python scripts that automate the creation of daily fantasy football rosters. Designed to maximize the provided raw data, this application was created with 1v1 and small contests in mind.

Currently supports Yahoo main slate Sunday matches and OwnersBox Thursday thru Monday games.

## Setup:

Run inside a virtual environment.  Make sure python-venv is available.  Then run these commands from the repository root directory:

```bash
python -m venv yahoo-dfs
yahoo-dfs/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use:

`> python fetch_data.py <format>`

`> python dfs-solver.py <file> <format>`

Where format is either `--ownersbox` || `-o`, or `--yahoo` || `-y`. If not specified it will default to Yahoo format.

Where file is the path to the rawdata `.csv` file.
